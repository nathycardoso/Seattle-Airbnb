# Seattle-Airbnb
EDA and Linear Regression with Seattle Airbnb data


Hello : )
This project is build to discovery some insights of airbnb acomodation in Seattle

### Project Motivation
for now, <b>we want to awnser some questions</b> like:

1) how much I need to rent a acomodation in seattle ?
2) what month of year, we have more available acomodation ?
3) what's the characterisct that rise the price ?

### Installation

but first, you <b>need to install some libs</b> let's go?
if you will run local, get sure you have libs below installed: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, plotly, sklearn. It's easier if you run on Anaconda with python version 3.*
or run the entire notebook on kaggle :) 

### File Descriptions
in this repository you will found 3 files:
1) the notebook with python code 
    - you need to have knowledge in python, pandas and familiarity with data analysis
2) calendar.csv dataset ( you nedd to unzip this file to use )
    - for each listings in airbnb, we have a line by day on entire year to know the availability 
3) listings.csv dataset
    - one listings by line with information about the host, the house, the price and more.

### Results

a little sumary about this project:
        
1) if you go to visit seattle, it's good to have 100$ to rent an accommodation. Some neighborhoods it's more expensive but 100$ its the price of 50% of listings
2) in the end of year we have more listings available. this can be caused by the winter thats come to the country.
3) some characteristics influences directly on listing price, like accommodates, guests_included, bathrooms and beds.
